    "entry": "An enjoyable web apps rely on engineers implementing the APIs that cover all of the small things. Those small things sometimes improve performance, usability, accessibility, and the app's relationship with its host system. The Wake Lock API is the latter -- an API that allows developers to instruct the host machine to not dim the screen or sleep, especially useful when users view videos"

    "entry": "While synchronous code is easier to follow and debug, async is generally better for performance and flexibility. Why hold up the show when you can trigger numerous requests at once and then handle them when each is ready? Promises are becoming a big part of the JavaScript world, with many new APIs being implemented with the promise philosophy."

    "entry": "Navigating and managing data structures is a really important skill for every level of engineer to have and improve upon. Over the years, the JavaScript language has continued to provide more methods for managing data structures, from Object.keys to Object.values and so on. One of my favorites is Object.entries, an API that provides the keys and values via an array of arrays."
